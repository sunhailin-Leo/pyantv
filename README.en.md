## üì£ Announcement

[AntV](https://github.com/antvis), initiated by Ant Group and open-sourced starting in 2017, reimagines data visualization by embedding the theory of graphical grammar into the JavaScript language. In response to rigid chart libraries that force a trade-off between flexibility and usability, we have categorized data visualization techniques into four series: 2, 6, 7, and 8, which respectively represent statistical analysis, graph analysis, geographical analysis, and unstructured data visualization. We have expanded these capabilities across different levels, including chart libraries, R&D tools, and AI-powered intelligent visualization.

Python, with its expressive power, is well-suited for data processing and AI scenarios. When data analysis and modeling meet data visualization, projects like [pyecharts](https://github.com/pyecharts/pyecharts), [py-vchart](https://github.com/VisActor/py-vchart), and [py-antv](https://github.com/sunhailin-Leo/pyantv) were born.

## ‚ú® Features

* API design inspired by [pyecharts](https://github.com/pyecharts/pyecharts), providing a smooth and fluent interface that supports chain calls.
* Includes most of the charts from AntV G2 (with plans to support more AntV G2 charts and other charts in the AntV ecosystem).
* Supports mainstream Notebook environments such as Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab.
* Can be easily integrated into popular Web frameworks like Flask, Sanic, Django (**Coming soon...**).
* Highly flexible configuration options allow for the creation of beautiful charts.
* Detailed documentation and examples help developers get up to speed quickly.
